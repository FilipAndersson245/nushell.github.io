# Nushell 0.85
Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.85 of Nu. This release adds...

# Where to get it
Nu 0.85 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.85.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Themes of this release / New features
## Nushell + Uutils = ‚ù§Ô∏è
üì¢The Nushell team is thrilled to announce ü•≥ that we've begun working with the `uutils/coreutils`
team on integrating some of their foundational core utilies into nushell. With this release, we've
started with the coreutils `cp` command, which we've temporarily named `ucp`. We're starting with
`ucp` to allow broad testing while the current nushell `cp` command remains the default. We've
already found one [bug](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/5257) in the coreutils `cp`
command and you might find others. Once it stabelizes, probably with the 0.86.0 release, we'll
remove the nushell `cp` command and rename `ucp` to `cp`. In keeping with the nushell style, we've
only added a handful of parameters. We can, and probably will, add more if the community determines
we need them. We're so very excited and would like to thank [terts](https://github.com/tertsdiepraam),
from the coreutils team, for his excellent help and special appreciation to
[dmatos2012](https://github.com/dmatos2012) for the, very iterative, first `uutils/coreutils`
integration PR for the `cp` command. To read more about how this came to be, checkout our blog post
