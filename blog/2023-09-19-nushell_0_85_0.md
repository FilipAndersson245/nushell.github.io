# Nushell 0.85.0



## Nushell + Uutils = ‚ù§Ô∏è

üì¢The Nushell team is thrilled to announce ü•≥ that we've begun working with the `uutils/coreutils` team on integrating some of their foundational core utilies into nushell. With this release, we've started with the coreutils `cp` command, which we've temporarily named `ucp`. We're starting with `ucp` to allow broad testing while the current nushell `cp` command remains the default. We've already found one [bug](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/5257) in the coreutils `cp` command and you might find others. Once it stabelizes, probably with the 0.86.0 release, we'll remove the nushell `cp` command and rename `ucp` to `cp`. In keeping with the nushell style, we've only added a handful of parameters. We can, and probably will, add more if the community determines we need them. We're so very excited and would like to thank [terts](https://github.com/tertsdiepraam), from the coreutils team, for his excellent help and special appreciation to [dmatos2012](https://github.com/dmatos2012) for the, very iterative, first `uutils/coreutils` integration PR for the `cp` command.
